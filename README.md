# Overview

This endeavor constitutes the development of a Tetris game implemented in C#. The primary objective of this undertaking is to enhance proficiency in the C# programming language, as well as to acquire comprehensive insights into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This is achieved through the practical application of key OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
